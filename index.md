**Welcome!** This website provides several visualizations of COVID-19
vaccination progress in Canada based on data collected mainly from
[COVID Canada](https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html) and
[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations). The
latest federal distribution schedule is [available
here](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment/vaccine-rollout.html).
The information below was last updated at 2021-07-20 16:08:01 MDT. For

estimates](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2018005-eng.htm)
as the basis for most of shares reported on this site. Other sources may
differ for this reason.

Canada’s daily pace:

Our 7-day average pace of administering shots: 369,517/day over the past
week and 463,136/day the week prior.

Canada’s average daily pace is slowing. We’re now 32% below our June 30
peak average of 542,779.

And finally, dose counts and the share of a population with a shot is
informative and important, but the population-level effective protection
this provides is lower. One dose is less effective than two, plus there
are lags in the vaccine’s effect along with numerous uncertainties
(especially where the variants are concerned). Based on a first-dose
efficacy of between 40 to 80 percent with a 2-3 week lag and a second
dose efficacy of 90 to 95 percent with a 1 to 2 week lag, our current
coverage of effective protection is between 45 to 61 percent. The margin
of error here is wide, which reflects the high degree of variation in
efficacy estimates and uncertainty with new variants. This is meant to
provide intuition and rough magnitudes, it does not rigorous public
health guidance. Follow your local public health agency’s guidelines!

As the share of the population with their first dose is growing large,
provinces the number of second doses will accelerate and the interval
between jabs shrink. Here’s the latest:
