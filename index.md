**Welcome!** This website provides several visualizations of COVID-19
vaccination progress in Canada based on data collected mainly from
[COVID Canada](https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html) and
[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations). The
latest federal distribution schedule is [available
here](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment/vaccine-rollout.html).

Canada’s pace of vaccination:

Today’s 301,323 shots given compares to an average of 356,350/day over
the past week and 362,841/day the week prior.

-   Pace req’d for 2 doses to 75% of Canadians by Sept 30: 276,165
-   At current avg pace, we reach 75% by Sep 01

And finally, dose counts and the share of a population with a shot is
informative and important. But the population-level effective protection
this provides is lower. One dose is less effective than two, plus there
are lags in the vaccine’s effect along with numerous uncertainties
(especially where the variants are concerned). Based on a two to three
week lag, a first-dose efficacy of between 40 to 80 percent, and a
second dose efficacy of 95 percent, our current coverage of effective
protection is between 16 to 33 percent.
