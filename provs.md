In Canada, vaccine doses are procured by the federal government and distributed to provinces for administration. Provinces set their own policies around who is eligible, length between first and second shots, and so on. To compare each province's vaccination rates, the following plots illustrate several relevant metrics.

But while the above matters for vaccination coverage, it may not full reflect the performance of getting shots into arms if more second doses are administered relative to first doses.

So a potentially better summary meausure is a comparison of the total doses per capita that have been administered, and the share of each province's deliveries from the federal government that have been used. This is illustrated below.

There is wide variation across provinces in the degree of vaccine hesitancy. Here's the fraction of each province and territories' population that both eligible for a COVID-19 shot but has not received one.

Differences across young people is particularly important.
